#The Idea
In one day I just wanted improve my time management so i decided to write notes all of what i do in day.

Notes have been taking in a notebook. After some time I concluded that for better analysis the notes in the notebook isn't enough.

The notebook is inconvenient in use and i had to take notes in my telegram channel and after that i should shift them in to the notebook, also in the end of the day i was analysing by hand that, also is inconvenient and analysis couldn't be faithful enough.
I guess disadvantages are obvious.

Photos of the notebook:
